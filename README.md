# Grooming

Informative Website about grooming

## Description
This Responsive Website was one of my first projects in web development, for which I am very fond of it. It started out as a school computer project on HTML Grooming and ended up styling it. The idea is to raise awareness about this global problem that affects us all, today more than ever with the rapid advance of technology, but mainly children and adolescents.

## Details
I developed this page a long time ago, between August and September 2020. The objective was to create a page that would have a series of sections on different topics within Grooming, and give a general perspective on Argentina.

I used a dark background to generate that feeling of depth, loneliness and abandonment that the song generates in me. I think the box style with the background: fixed looks very good.

## Key Technologies used
